## Kolmogorov Complexity

Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the shortest piece of computer program that will produce the object as output. For example:

<pre><code>
abababababababababab
</code></pre>

can be represented by "ab 10 times". Kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical objects, not just strings.
