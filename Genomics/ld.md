## Linkage Disequillibrium

Linkage Disequillibrium or LD is non-random association of alleles at different loci. If a particular allele at a loci is found together with a specific allele at another loci on same chromosome at a frequency higher than expected if they were seggregating independently in a population, then the loci are said to be in disequillibrium. It can occur when two population that were previously separated come into contact. LD weakens over time because of recombination. LD assists in genome association studies (?).
