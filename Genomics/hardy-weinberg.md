## Hardy-Weinberg principle

Hardy-Weinberg principle states that the allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant in absence of other evolutionary influences like mating choice, mutation, genetic drift etc. These are the seven assumptions underlying Hardy-Weinberg equillibrium:
* Oganisms are diploid
* They reproduce sexually
* The population size is infinitely large
* Random mating
* Generations are non-overlapping
* No migrations, muations or selections
* Allele frequencies are same in both sexes
