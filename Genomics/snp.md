## Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

SNP is a single nucleotide variation occuring among species. The variation should occur in more than 1% of population to be considered a SNP. 

For example, at a specific base position in human genome nucleotide C occurs in most of the individuals, but for some minority of individual the base position is occupied by base A. There is a SNP at that base position with two nucleotides A and C.
