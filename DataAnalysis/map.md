## Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate
#### Feb 22, 2016

Lets say you have a prior belief about something. You gather evidences trying to support/reject these beliefs. The decision you will make (posterior) depends upon your prior belief and the evidences that you have gathered. MAP is basically the maximum posterior belief you have after you go through your prior belief and all the evidences you have gathered.
