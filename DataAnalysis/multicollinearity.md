## Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity is a phenomenon where two or more predictors in a multiple regression are highly correlated. It does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of a model; it only reduces the calculations regarding the individual predictors.

Consequences of multicollinearity:
* Small changes in input data can result in large changes in model.
* A principal of this type of data redundancy is that it might cause overfitting.
