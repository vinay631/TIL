## Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

AIC is used to select a model which is a good fit to the truth but with few parameters. It is a way of selecting the best model from a set of models. The selected model minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (?) distance between the truth and the model. It is defined as:

AIC = -2(ln(likelihood)) + 2k, where k is the number of free parameters in the model and likelihood is the probability of the data given the model.
