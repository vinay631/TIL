## SOLID (Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion)
#### Date: Feb 19, 2016

* Single Responsibility: A class should only have one responsibility
* Open/closed principle: Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification
* Liskov Substitution: An object should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program
* Interface Segregation: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface
* Dependency Inversion: Core message here is to strive to have dependencies move towards higher level. Abstractions should not depend on details. Code should depend on things that are same or higher level. High level policy should not depend on low level policy
